# Python-File-Hander
 File Handler Python  

## 📌 What is this project?  
This is a simple Python program that performs basic file handling operations, including:  
- Reading data from a text file.  
- Finding and replacing specific words in the file.  
- Saving the modified content back to the file.  
- Implementing error handling to gracefully handle file-related exceptions.  

## 🛠️ Why was this project created?  
File handling is an essential part of programming, used in various applications like:  
- Text processing and editing.  
- Log file management.  
- Configuration file updates.  
This project serves as a practical example of handling text files efficiently with Python.  

## 🚀 How does it work?  
1. The program prompts the user for the filename and checks if it exists.  
2. It reads the content of the file and displays it.  
3. The user inputs a word to find and the replacement word.  
4. The program replaces all occurrences of the word and updates the file.  
5. Error handling ensures the program gracefully handles:  
   - Missing files  
   - Permission errors  
   - Other unexpected issues
